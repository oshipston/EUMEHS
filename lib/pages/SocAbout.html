    In August 2016, a colleague and I (having just graduated from our respective intercalated degrees in Medical Ethics and Law, and Medicine and Literature) were looking for a means of integrating our intercalated studies with our upcoming clinical attachments.

    Sadly, and this had historically been the case throughout our 4 years of undergraduate medicine, opportunities for interdisciplinary learning in the core medical curriculum were hard to come by. Whilst we were given extensive teaching on cell biology, and the complex mechanism of ion transport, there was a distinct absence of the medical humanities from our lectures. Regarding medical ethics, although it formed an important component of our pre-clinical years, the manner in which it was assessed was wholly reductive. With the exception of one critical essay, as students, our understanding and application of ethics was examined through a restrictive, multiple-choice based system, which denied us of an any real opportunity to exercise ethical reasoning – a method which we found to be entirely counterintuitive.
    </p>
    <p>
    And so, rather than waiting for wholesale change to be made within the curriculum, from our common interest in both ethics and humanities, Sarah and I decided to form EUMEHS.

    <p>
    Though we began small, as a society of only four or five members, interest in our work has grown considerably over the past year. Our vision was always simple – EUMEHS would serve as a platform from which the intersections between medicine, ethics and the humanities could be explored. The experience of suffering, perceptions of death, the illness narrative and the politicisation of healthcare – these are but a few of the many aspects of contemporary medical practice from which popular ethical debate derives.
    </p>
    <p>
    But at EUMEHS, rather than insisting upon the reduction of ethical reasoning through an oppressive MCQ-based model of assessment, we instead encourage an intersectional, academic discourse amongst medics, historians, artists and theologians alike, in order to make better sense of the uncertainties we are faced with on a regular basis. Ethical instruction is all around us – in literature, in art, in theatre, in music and in film; whilst it might not always be immediately apparent, we hope to at least provide a means from which it can be acknowledged, if not understood.
    </p>
    <p>
    As a place for learning, and as a city at the heart of the Western Enlightenment, Edinburgh has for so long had a rich tradition of ground-breaking academia. And though in recent years there has been a wholesale compartmentalisation of knowledge amongst subjects, we believe that the addition of a more fluid, intersectional society can only be positive in creating new, exciting intellectual discourse to the city of Edinburgh.
    </p>
    <p>
    And finally, having established ourselves as progressive force within the University, we hope that in the coming years, we can continue to grow, inspiring the future generations to create positive change not only in the medical profession, but in the wider community too.
