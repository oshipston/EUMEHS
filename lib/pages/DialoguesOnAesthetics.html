              <p> Whilst our core values (of innovation and open debate) at EUMEHS are unchanging, at times, it is difficult to feel assured that our efforts to practically apply them are successful. For, though a strong conceptual foundation is vital, the importance of reaching out meaningfully to our wider audience is far greater. </p>

                I suppose that it is, in part, a reflection of our relative infancy as a society; the process is a new one, and one that with time, we will hopefully improve.

                <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/184852525391854" target=blank>Dialogues on Aesthetics</a>, (as part of a wider series on embodiment), is an attempt to understand the nature of our bodies outwith the rigorously empirical context so focussed upon in biomedical and clinical teaching. For, whilst it is widely acknowledged that, through medicine, we make sense of the science of our bodies, what is less well understood is that this enquiry refashions not only our knowledge of bodily processes, but also our perceptions of physical beauty.

                <p>
                To not admit to medicine’s authority in shaping, and (in some cases), defining our perceptions of beauty would be reductive, for the historical evidence is both compelling, and blatant. Whether it is in: Corporis Fabrica, Vesalius’ outstanding exercise in anatomical illustration, where his images of the human form forge an indelible impression as to what material, physiological beauty is; Romantic representation of tuberculosis in the 19th century as aesthetically desirable disease; or our modern preoccupation with measurable homogeneity, medicine’s role in influencing what we consider to be beautiful is clear.

                <p>
                From this position of authority, an ethical debate emerges as to the responsibility the medical professional has in embracing heterogeneity, instead of insisting (as has historically been the case) upon a monoculture of human form. Yet, a tension is exposed, because whilst the threat of homogeneity is clear, so too are the dangers of anorexia and obesity. And so, the uncertainty grows as we struggle to come to terms with what is aesthetically compelling, socially permissible and clinically acceptable.

                <p>
                The ethics of beauty then, is far from straightforward, exposing not only our own deeply held prejudices, but also of reminding us of medicine’s role in verifying and rejecting the potentially harmful attitudes held within a wider society.

                What we hope our audience members will take from our series then, is that whilst our health is in part determined by our material form, and whilst the organisation of that form is susceptible to radical change, what remains equal in any case is our fundamental quality of being human; something that must always be centralised, above all else, in any medical context.
