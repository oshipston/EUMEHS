                "Hi! I’m Haris, a fifth year medical student here in Edinburgh. Starting the EUMEHS initiative has been both exciting and rewarding. For a while now, I’ve maintained that the study of medicine is fundamentally interdisciplinary, and throughout medical school, I’ve committed my academic research into exploring this. Intercalating in Medicine and Literature was invaluable, and this year, I’m dedicating more time into studying key periods in the history of medicine; specifically, the Romantic period and Islamic renaissance. I guess I hope that, in doing so, I might be better equipped to deal with the massive uncertainties which oppose medical science today."

I did my Intercalated degree in Global Health Policy; an area full of ethical debates and dilemmas. I'm currently conducting a research project with, particularly, drug overdose patients and have taken a particular interest in ethical research practises. "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" is my favourite book, and in second year I organised a project to diagnose a fictional patient in a French novel using modern psychiatry techniques. I'm excited to see where the society will take us this year - there's lots in the pipeline!"

I am delighted to be continuing in the role of secretary for the EUMEHS for the upcoming academic year. I have an interest in medical ethics, with a particular interest in how ethics is taught within the medical curriculum; having undertaken a project looking into how perspectives of medical ethics teaching differ between medical students and practising junior doctors. I also have a keen interest in medical history, so feel very lucky to be studying in a city with such a rich and colourful medical past, which I hope can continue to inspire its current students. We have laid the foundations for what should be an exciting second year and I am looking forward to watching our society flourish."

I hope to help the Society grow in stature by acquiring and managing its funds and building up relationships with sponsors. I intercalated in Physiology, and am soon doing a project in Neurosurgery, so I might not be your textbook EUMEHS member, but after attending the Society’s stimulating events last year I’ve come to realise how relevant it is in everyday medical and surgical practice. I can’t wait for the year ahead and to encourage more discourse amongst medical students on matters which have often been hard to comprehend."

As the Social Media rep for EUMEHS I can't wait to see how I can best open up the society to both medical and non-medical students. In second year I was involved in a project to write a children's book including hosting an Instagram account showing our illustration works. I'm looking forward to starting clinical years, but more important to have a year off to read (and help out with the society!) first."

This is my second year living in Edinburgh after graduating from the University of St Andrews as a Bachelor of Medicine in 2016. As a Sri Lankan Tamil-Canadian studying in Scotland I am continually learning about culture and identity and the means of which our environment influences our perceptions and experiences. I had the honour and privilege to spend the summer working at the Palliative Care Unit at Baycrest Hospital in Toronto, Ontario where I was constantly compelled to contemplate the ethics and humanities in medicine. I am a mental health advocate, intersectional feminist and believe in a holistic approach to delivering medicine."
